# Redis-datastructures
A Laravel + Redis library to create more advanced caching datastructures

# Usage

`// TODO`

# Testing
Run `composer update`, and then `composer test`

By default, it will use the predis client, and assume connection details as defined in `phpunit.xml.dist`.
This can be customized by copying and editing the dist file to `phpunit.xml` before running the tests.

On Github Actions, the package is tested against both predis & phpredis.
